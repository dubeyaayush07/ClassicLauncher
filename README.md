# ClassicLauncher
A launcher application to display and open already installed applications. I built this application to deepen my understanding
about intents, intent filters, tasks and how applications interact in the Android environment. Each application has its own 
task associated with it.

To build the application clone or download the master branch then import the project using Android Studio.
